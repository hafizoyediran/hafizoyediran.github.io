                            <p>A system for identifying safety hazards in construction robot operations by combining 4D Building Information Modeling with automated rule checking. This project integrates spatial awareness and temporal planning to preemptively identify safety concerns.</p>

                            <p>Falls remain the leading cause of construction site injuries, yet hazard identification during design is often overlooked. This study introduces a proof-of-concept BIM plugin that integrates automated fall hazard detection with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered nudging to improve proactive safety planning.</p>

                            <h4 class="item-title">Construction Robotics Education</h4>
                            <p>Robotics is becoming increasingly important in construction, yet many Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) students lack access to practical, robotics-focused education, often due to the heavy programming requirements of existing robotics curricula.</p>
                            <p>This project begins by analyzing how robotics is currently taught across top universities, identifying the balance between technical programming and construction-oriented decision-making. Based on this analysis, an educational platform will be developed that allows AEC students to simulate and plan construction robot tasks without requiring programming skills. The platform emphasizes task planning, safety, and productivity, helping students focus on managing robotics in real-world construction scenarios.</p>
