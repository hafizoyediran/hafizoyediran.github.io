                    <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Biography</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Hafiz Oyediran, originally from Lagos, Nigeria, recently completed his Ph.D. in Construction Engineering and Management with a minor in Computer Science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln under the guidance of Dr. Kyungki Kim (May 2025). His dissertation, "Robot-Integrated 4D Building Information Modeling (4D BIM): Framework for Planning Safe Autonomous Construction Operations in Dynamic Environments," explores innovative approaches to construction automation and safety verification in complex construction environments. He currently teaches at the University of New Haven's Tagliatela College of Engineering in Connecticut.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Hafiz brings a wealth of practical experience to academia, having worked extensively in the Nigerian construction industry for about a decade. His career journey includes roles as a Construction Manager, Site Engineer, and Structural Engineer, where he supervised major projects including pile supervision for buildings and pedestrian bridges, construction of faculty buildings at the University of Africa, Nigeria, and various commercial and residential developments. This industry background provides him with unique insights into real-world construction challenges that inform his research and teaching.</p>
                    
                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">For his academic and research contributions, Hafiz has been recognized with several prestigious awards including the Dean Fellowship from the College of Engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln (2024-2025), the Milton E. Mohr Fellowship (2022-2023), and participation in the Google Research Computer Science Mentorship Program (2022). He was also selected as a Future Faculty Career Exploration Program Fellow at Rochester Institute of Technology and a Trailblazer in Engineering Fellow at Purdue University.</p>

                        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Research Focus</h3>
                        <p>During my Ph.D, my research focused on advancing the safe and efficient integration of autonomous robots into construction environments. I developed a 4D Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based planning system that enables autonomous robots to operate effectively on dynamic construction sites. This system accounts for spatiotemporal variables such as task sequencing, site layout, and human presence, and includes a rule-based safety layer to detect and mitigate potential hazards during the planning phase. My work addresses a critical gap in current construction planning methods by enabling robot task simulation and coordination with human workers.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">In parallel, I contributed to the NSF-funded <strong>VADER 2</strong> project (<em>Improving Engineering Student Engagement, Self-Efficacy, Diversity Awareness, and Retention using Visualization and Virtual/Augmented Reality Technologies</em>), in collaboration with Georgia Tech and Tennessee State University. My role focused on developing and evaluating immersive VR/AR modules designed to enhance student learning, engagement, and retention in engineering. This interdisciplinary initiative applied evidence-based educational frameworks to improve diversity awareness and cognitive skill development in AEC and other engineering fields.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Together, these experiences have shaped my research vision: to bridge robotics, safety, and immersive technology for smarter construction and more inclusive engineering education.</p>

                        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Leadership and Service</h3>
                        <p>Beyond his research, Hafiz is passionate about advancing construction technology adoption across Africa. He co-founded and serves as General Secretary to the Board of Directors of the BIM Africa Initiative, an organization that provides educational awareness, training, and mentorship to students and professionals across Africa on Building Information Modeling. Through this initiative, he has organized numerous programs that have impacted the construction industry throughout the continent.</p>
                        
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Hafiz is also dedicated to mentoring the next generation of engineers. He has guided Master's students in research activities, contributed to STEM outreach programs including the Architecture, Construction, and Engineering (ACE) Mentor Program where he introduced 150 high school students to construction robotics applications, and serves as a manuscript reviewer for several prestigious journals including Automation in Construction and the Journal of Information Technology in Construction.</p>
